<h1>The Best Movies According to Andrey</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse/ Across the Spider-verse</h3>
<p>These two are my favorite animated movies. The story, the animation and the soundtacks are simply brilliant.</p>

<h3>The Lord Of The Rings</h3>
<p>The Lord Of The Rings trilogy is the greatest fantasy movie trilogy of all-time, in my humble opinion. </p>
  
<h3>About Time</h3>
<p>It is a very hopeful film. With a beautiful message.</p>
